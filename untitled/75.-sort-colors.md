# 75. Sort Colors

{% embed url="https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/" %}

Medium

Given an array with _n_ objects colored red, white or blue, sort them [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) ****so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.

Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.

**Note:** You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.

**Example:**

```text
Input: [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
```

**Follow up:**

* A rather straight forward solution is a two-pass algorithm using counting sort. First, iterate the array counting number of 0's, 1's, and 2's, then overwrite array with total number of 0's, then 1's and followed by 2's.
* Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant space?

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public void sortColors(int[] nums) {
        int point0 = 0;
        int point2 = nums.length - 1;
        for (int i=0; i < nums.length;) {
            if (point0 >= point2 || i > point2) {
                break; // notice this
            }
            if (nums[i] == 0) {
                swap(nums, point0, i);
                point0++;
                i++;
            } else if (nums[i] == 2) {
                swap(nums, i, point2);
                point2--;
            } else if (nums[i] == 1) {
                i++;
            }
        }
    }
    public void swap(int[] nums, int i, int j) {
        int temp = nums[i];
        nums[i] = nums[j];
        nums[j] = temp;
    }
}
```

## Note

1. notice the end condition \(i &gt; point2\)
