# 80. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II



80. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II

Medium

Given a sorted array _nums_, remove the duplicates [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) such that duplicates appeared at most _twice_ and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by **modifying the input array** [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) with O\(1\) extra memory.

**Example 1:**

```text
Given nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3],

Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3 respectively.

It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,1,2,3,3],

Your function should return length = 7, with the first seven elements of nums being modified to 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3 and 3 respectively.

It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
```

**Clarification:**

Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?

Note that the input array is passed in by **reference**, which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.

Internally you can think of this:

```text
// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeDuplicates(nums);

// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);
}
```

## Solution

### sol1

make the point to the end of new array, and maintian the current value and appear times, if current value changed, then add the new value into new array, if current value did not change and appear times less than 2, also add the new value into new array.

```java
class Solution {
    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        int currIndex = 0;
        int currValue = -1;
        int times = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (currValue != nums[i]) {
                times = 0;
                currValue = nums[i];
                nums[currIndex++] = nums[i];
            } else {
                // add times, 
                times++;
                if (times < 2)  {
                    nums[currIndex++] = nums[i];
                }
            }
        }
        return currIndex;
    }
}
```

### sol2

make the point to the end of new array, compare the current element and the pointed - 2 element, if current element is greater, then just add it into the new array.

```java
class Solution {
    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        // solution 2 if next element is bigger then currIndex's prev 2 element, than move element to currIndex
        if (nums.length<=2) {
            return nums.length;
        }
        int currIndex = 2;
        for (int i = 2; i < nums.length; i++) {
            // System.out.println("nums[i-2]:" + nums[i-2] + "nums[i]:" + nums[i]);
            if (nums[currIndex - 2] < nums[i]) {
                nums[currIndex++] = nums[i];
            }
        }
        return currIndex;
    }
}
```
